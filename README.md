# HTML, CSS

This repo contains all the materials for HYF module 1: HTML, CSS.  The homework and exercises are in the main repository for you to fork and complete, all the study materials are [in the wiki](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/HTML-CSS-GitHub/wiki) for you to study.

While this module is called "HTML & CSS", it's important to remember that you also need to learn how to Fork & Pull Request on GitHub, to Push and Pull your work between GitHub and your computer, and to develop locally on your computer using a browser+DevTools and a specialized text editor.

In the first weeks it's very likely that you'll spend as much time figuring out how to publish and turn in your projects as you will spend building them.  _This is totally normal and OK!_  Working like a developer takes time and practice to get good at, and at this point in your learning it's even more important than mastering HTML & CSS!

So on days when you find yourself spending a couple hours trying to push your homework or send a PR for your coach to look over your homework, remind yourself that it's all time well spent. Mastering these skills _now_ will free your time _later_ to focus on studying the more interesting and challenging skills in this course.

## Reading Materials & Lesson Plans

To prepare for (and review!) each week's class you can go to the [HTML & CSS wiki](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/HTML-CSS-GitHub/wiki) where you'll find a summary of each week's learning objectives, in-class examples, and extra reading materials.

## Weekly Projects

Each week you will be required to complete a small project.  The goal of these projects is to practice planning and building projects in a methodical and structured way, and to write the cleanest and most correct code possible.  The goal of these projects _is not_ to build the fanciest most beautiful website, to use all the latest CSS tricks, or to use cool libraries and API's.

Here's a short list of do's and don't's that can help you stay on track:

__DO__
* Use only plain HTML & CSS
* Completely finish one step of the project before moving on to the next
* Be very careful about your CSS classes, selectors and id's
* Properly indent your code
* Find the simplest solution to each step of the project
* Start each step of the project by copy-pasting the last step

__Don't__
* ... think that your site can be pretty enough to make up for messy code
* ... use any CSS libraries
* ... make the the steps of the project do less _or more_ than is assigned
* ... move on to the next step before the previous one is finished
* ... include any JavaScript

__To complete and submit the weekly projects__:
1. fork this repository (if you haven't yet)
1. clone it to your computer (if you haven't yet)
1. complete each project by the weekly deadline
1. push your code to your fork on github
1. send a pull request to the main HYFB repository
    * Call it ```Week n: yourName```, ie. ```Week 2: Laura```
    * Don't forget to tag your coach in your pull requests!
1. Your coach will use GitHub Issues to give you feedback
    * You and your coach can discuss the feedback right in the issue
    * Your coach will close the issue when you've addressed their feedback
1 (you can practice this submission process [with this exercise](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/git-github-practice/wiki/Pull-Requesting))
1. You'll know you've finished the project when:
    * All the issues in your repository are closed
    * Your coach has closed your PR in the main HYf repo. (without merging your work!)

Take a look at the completed example to study to get an idea what's expected of you:

* [it's source code](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/HTML-CSS-GitHub/tree/master/example-project-feedback-form).

## Exercises

Along side Sunday classes and weekly projects, you'll be expected to complete a set of focused exercises. While the project teaches how to integrate your skills, the exercises will focus on strengthening individual skills.  This module's exercises can be found [in the exercise folder](./module-exercises).

Exercises are all due at the end of the Module, we won't be checking your exercises each week (unless you have some questions of course!).  We also won't accept any homework for JavaScript 1 until you have submitted your exercises from HTML & CSS.

So be organized about this!  It's a lot easier to finish these exercises if you study them an hour a day than if you cram it all into the last weekend, and you'll learn a whole lot more along the way.
